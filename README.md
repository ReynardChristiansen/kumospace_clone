# Kumospace Clone

This project is inspired by Kumospace, a real-time application that leverages Socket.IO for seamless communication. It enables users to:

- Join virtual spaces and interact in real-time, similar to Zoom.
- Travel within the space, with their videos dynamically moving along using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
